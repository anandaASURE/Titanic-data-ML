# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning  
My first practical project in ML using the **Kaggle Titanic dataset**.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Used **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and modeling.  
- Explored different machine learning models to predict survival.  
- Achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set.  

## 📂 Files in This Repository  
- `Titanic-ML.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with all analysis and models.  
- `train.csv` → Titanic training dataset.  
- `README.md` → This project description.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
I plan to improve the model by:  
✔️ Hyperparameter tuning  
✔️ Feature engineering  
✔️ Trying deep learning models
